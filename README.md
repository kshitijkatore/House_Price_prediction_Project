#### Steps for model creation
* 1.Gather and clean the data: Collect the data that you will use for training and testing your model. This data may be in various formats such as CSV, Excel, or a database. You will need to clean the data by removing missing values, removing outliers, and transforming the data as necessary.

* 2.Split the data into training and testing sets: Split your data into two sets: one for training the model and another for testing the model. The typical split is 80% for training and 20% for testing, but this can vary depending on the size of the dataset.

* 3.Feature selection: Select the features or independent variables that will be used to train the model. It's important to choose features that are relevant to the problem you are trying to solve.

* 4.Scaling and normalization: Scale and normalize the data to ensure that each feature has a similar range and distribution. This step is important because linear regression is sensitive to the scale of the features.

* 5.Train the model: Use the training dataset to train the linear regression model. During training, the model will learn the coefficients for each feature that will be used to make predictions.

* 6.Evaluate the model: Use the testing dataset to evaluate the performance of the model. You can use metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, and others to evaluate the performance of the model.

* 7.Tune the model: If the model's performance is not satisfactory, you can tune the hyperparameters such as the learning rate or regularization parameter to improve the model's performance.

* 8.Deploy the model: Once the model has been trained and tested, you can deploy it to make predictions on new data.
## üìùDescription

* Thise projects based on LinearRegression algorithm.

### Using LinearRegression
```
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
lin_reg_model = LinearRegression()
lin_reg_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
